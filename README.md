Project Goals:

A group project focused on building optimal models to predict account balance in an artifical bank data set in R

Quick Summary:

Project 1 aims to construct a classical OLS multiple regression model through careful variable selection.
The final model to be considered is determined by the lowest BIC criterion.

Project 2 aims to construct the best predictive model through more complex methods such as Best Subset Selection,Regularization,Bagging & Random Forest.
Models were considered with bias-variance trade-offs in mind but more importantly via overall test Mean Squared Error of the model

The final model from Project 2 was parsed into a hidden data set, the group with the best model were given extra credit. Results can be found in Final_Test_Result

Codes:

Codes may be found in the appendix of each report for replication.
Data Sets for the output of the projects have also been uploaded for use if need be.
